# rewrite sources — and anything rewritten AFTER `git add` is green here
# and absent from the commit. mailbox's 1.0.0 commit carried a lock file
# still naming version 0.0.0; the container build refused it one step
# before a release tag, and nothing local had objected. So: fingerprint
# the tree now, compare once the checks are done, and refuse rather than
# report a green run over a tree that moved underneath it.
